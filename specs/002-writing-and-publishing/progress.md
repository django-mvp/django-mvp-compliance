# Progress — 002 Writing and publishing a document without a developer

Run narrative. Newest entry last.

## 2026-09-22 — S3 PLAN

Picked up off the feature queue as `ready`. Branch `002-writing-and-publishing` cut from
`origin/main` at `4f55e4d`, with the stale local branch left over from the specification run
deleted first after confirming its `specs/` content was identical to what merged as #13.

**Spec re-read against FS-001, the one feature delivered since this specification landed.** No
contradiction. FS-002's specification was written the same day and with FS-001's in hand — it names
it as a dependency throughout and adds no state to either model — and FS-001's `spec.md` has not
been touched since. The one place they meet is FR-004, where this feature's toolbar has to agree
with the allow list FS-001 applies at publication; the allow list is wider than the toolbar, which
is agreement rather than conflict, and T018 tests it in both directions.

Baseline verified green on the branch before planning: conformance, lint, typecheck, 65 tests and
build.

Research settled three things worth naming. The specification itself decides the editor — US-3
scenario 5 compares the editor's inline display with the preview, which needs an editor that has
one. EasyMDE ships no icons despite writing Font Awesome class names into every button, so the
icons are ours. And the preview reads the stored row rather than the editor's buffer, because that
is the only design under which SC-004 is true by construction.

`decisions.md` gained D8 to D12 and ADR verdicts for D1 to D7, which the specification run left
open.
